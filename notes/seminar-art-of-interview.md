## Preparation
  * Interview begins at the moment you get the interview
  * Research the company
    - Company's website
    - Periodicals: previous data of the company
    - UVA library
    - UVA career services (alumni information) 
  * Get a UVA-logo leather folder to hold resumes during career fair and interview
  * Get an attire (quality suit), $500~$800

## Entering the room: American business protocol
  * Keep eye contact and **smile**
  * Don't turn back to the interviewer (seems odd and impolite to interviewers)
  * To lessen nervousness, to relax: relax hands... (Nervousness: America's first fear: public speaking; 2nd: dying... LOL)
  * Interviewers are not your enemy: they want to hire you. So you should respect and honor those interviewers by those gestures (eye contact, don't turn back on them, smiling, etc.)
  * Warm-up is necessary for sportsmen: to condition, avoid injuries and play in the peak. So is it for you. 
  * Physical warm-up is important for interview

## Introduction
  * Smiling + eye contact + posture
  * Salutation: pick the right one for yourself (Hi, Hello, Good afternoon, ...)
  * Handshake: medium firm (you don't want to hurt lady's hands with jewelry)
  * Say your name clearly: avoid the negative energy zone. English tends to put important information in the end of the sentence. So don't loose power towards the end of sentence. 
  * For international students, can use Americanized names. This is according to Purdue's survey, and Purdue has the most international students on campus in US). 

## Transition/Transformation
  * During sitting down and locating the chair (in transformation), don't turn back to the interviewers -> still honor interviewers.
  * Sitting with an angle towards interviewers (to create a 3-D image, a depth. People get tired fairly quickly by looking at a 2-D flat image.)
  * Adjust the sitting gesture during the interview (to regain the focus). Face the one who are interviewing you. 

## Exiting
  * Exit: interviewers stand up, shake. If they don't, don't shake. 
  * And don't make mistake in exit. Interview doesn't end until you are miles away... 

## Other
  * Talk from the heart, not from your head: this is what strikes the interviewers most. What do you for fun, what is your favorite movie... (this kind of questions mean they want you to talk from your heart).
  * Elevator speech: write up, practice, memorize, and unmemorize (sounds like a natural speech)
  * Details are in the document attached.
