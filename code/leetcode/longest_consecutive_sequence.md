Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length 
of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
the longest consecutive elements sequence is 
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
