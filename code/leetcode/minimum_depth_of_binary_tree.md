Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the 
shortest path from the root node down to the nearest 
leaf node.
</pre>

* Solution 1: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/minimum_depth_of_binary_tree_easy/Solution1.py)
* Solution 2: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/minimum_depth_of_binary_tree_easy/Solution2.py)

Solution 1 is a trivial recursive solution, and Solution 2 is iterative.
