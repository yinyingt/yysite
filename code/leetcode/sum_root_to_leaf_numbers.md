Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which 
represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3

The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25. 
</pre>

* Solution 1: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/sum_root_to_leaf_numbers_medium/Solution1.py)
* Solution 2: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/sum_root_to_leaf_numbers_medium/Solution2.py)

Both solutions are recursive. Solution 2 is more elegant..
