Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as 
one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity. 
</pre>

* Solution 1: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/merge_k_sorted_lists_hard/Solution1.py)
* Solution 2: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/merge_k_sorted_lists_hard/Solution2.py)

Actually this problem is not hard. Solution 1 uses merge 2 lists code as the subroutine. Solution 2 uses a priority queue for optimized operation.
