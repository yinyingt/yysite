Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a 
valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only 
nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only 
nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must 
also be binary search trees.
</pre>

* Solution 2: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/validate_binary_search_tree_medium/Solution2.py)
* Solution 3: [Python](https://github.com/lijunhw/leetcode_practice/blob/master/validate_binary_search_tree_medium/Solution3.py)
