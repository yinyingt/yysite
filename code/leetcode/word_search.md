Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/word-search/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in 
the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially 
adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those 
horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter 
cell may not be used more than once.

For example, given board =

[
  ["ABCE"],
  ["SFCS"],
  ["ADEE"]
]

word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
</pre>
