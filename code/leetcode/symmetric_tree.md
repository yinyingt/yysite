Problem description is [here](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/), or as follows: 

<pre>
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of 
itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively 
and iteratively.
