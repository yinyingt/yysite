Here are links to posts or tutorials I found useful when learning nRF51822.

* ARM mbed talks about [firmware over the air (FOTA) update](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/wiki/Firmware-Over-the-Air-FOTA-Updates)

* Why do I get “Error: Flash download failed – Cortex-M0” when downloading a project from Keil? [This](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/64/why-do-i-get-error-flash-download-failed-cortex-m0-when-downloading-a-project-from-keil/)  and [this]

* [Dynamic temperature info advertizing](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-ble-app-temp/blob/master/main.c)

* [ADC input impedance in nRF51822](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/1782/nrf51822-what-is-the-input-currentimpedance/)

* ADC conversion time is about 68 us in nRF51822, which makes the max sample rate about 14 kHz; see [here](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/2300/nrf51822-adc-samplerate/). 

* How to [configure high-drive on the GPIO pins](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/1089/can-nrf51822-drive-led-directly-by-gpio/ . The information is also available in nRF51822 reference manual page 68) of nRF51822. 

* How to [deal with the unused GPIO pins on nRF51822](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/14567/unused-gpio-pins/)

* When using app_button libraries:
  - The app_buttons libraries use an application timer (sourced by RTC) and two timer events implicitly. One may need to check the max allowed timers and size of timer queue to accommodate. 
  - GPIO input may have internal pull-up or pull-down resistor. This may give weird behavior if not taken into consideration. To disable it and use external pull-up or pull-down, do something like (nRF51 SDK 8.0.0)

{% highlight C %}
static app_button_cfg_t buttons[] =
{
	// this enables internal pull-up
    // {BUTTON_SS, false, BUTTON_PULL, button_event_handler}  

    // this disables the internal pull-up, to use the external pull-up
    {BUTTON_SS, APP_BUTTON_ACTIVE_LOW, NRF_GPIO_PIN_NOPULL, button_event_handler}  
};
{% endhighlight %}

* Flash write/erase cycles of nRF51822 is 2000 minimum, according to Table 19 in the Product Specification v 3.1.

* The nRF51822 internal (die) temperature characteristics: [results reported by a user in Nordic's Devzone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/31661/nrf51822-temp-internal-temperature-sensor-characteristic/).

* [Interpretation of nRF51822 die temperature](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/6662/die-temperature-51822/).

* [Peripheral protection and usage by SoftDevice](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.130.sds.v1.0.0%2Fsd_resource_reqs%2Fhw_block_interrupt_vector.html&cp=2_7_2_0_10_2)

* [A non-blocking delay in nRF51822 using app timers](https://gist.github.com/lijunhw/89cecaf82df3ee651464)

* [nRF51 current consumption for common scenarios](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/blogs/679/nrf51-current-consumption-for-common-scenarios/)

* Understand the concept of notification: "This operation (notification) is initiated by the server when a new value is written to a notify-enabled characteristic. __If the client has subscribed to notifications on that characteristic, then the new value is pushed to the client when it is written.__ Notifications are not acknowledged, but you may send more than one notification in a single connection interval, which can be helpful for __maximizing throughput__. Notifications cannot be enabled by the server; they must be enabled by the client in order for the actual data transmission to occur." from [this post](http://mbientlab.com/blog/bluetooth-low-energy-introduction/).
